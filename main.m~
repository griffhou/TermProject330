% Basically u is the array of y values (ie the dependent variable). For each time t
% there is a u value for every x. Therefore at every t the new value of u is
% found using finite difference methods that solve the linear advection
% equation (du/dt + F*du/dx = 0).

% We could make F more complicated to make it more fun?
% Right now I'm just using 1.

% Finite differences just means we assume:
% du/dt = (unew - u)/deltat and
% dx/dt = (u(p+1)-u(p-1))/2*deltax for this centrally spaced scheme
% then we just use algebra to solve for unew given
% (unew - u)/deltat = -(u(p+1)-u(p-1))/2*deltax
% That is how the "First Order Upwind Scheme" was derived, we believe;
% mostly it is the scheme we found in a textbook detailing these sorts of
% systems that seemed possible to implement here.

% courant_num is the "Courant number" and it factors in deltat, deltax, and the wave
% speed.

% Functionality is broken out into functions for two reasons:
    % Hoping for faster performance for large num_spaces
    % Desired practice doing this in Matlab, as it is generally considered
    % best practice in many programming languages
